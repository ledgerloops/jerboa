<p>There are two ways to get started with LedgerLoops: using our implementation or your own one.</p>
<h2 id="deploying-our-technology-in-your-business-network-">Deploying our technology in your business network.</h2>
<p>Now that the LedgerLoops technology has been proven to work, we can deploy it in local communities.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re interesting in exploring the benefits, please contact michiel@unhosted.org.</p>
<h2 id="creating-your-own-implementation">Creating your own implementation</h2>
<p>The internet draft describing the LedgerLoops algorithm will soon be published through the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
This will allow you to implement your own LedgerLoops-compatible software.
In the future, we plan to make more resources available such as a test suite and a test net where you can analyse the performance
and compliance of your software, as well as a public global backbone network for obligaction clearing, and software-as-a-service solutions.</p>
