# Getting Started with LedgerLoops
There are two ways to get started with LedgerLoops: using our implementation or your own one.

## Deploying our technology in your business network.
Now that the LedgerLoops technology has been proven to work, we can deploy it in local communities.

If you're interesting in exploring the benefits, please contact michiel@unhosted.org.

## Creating your own implementation
The internet draft describing the LedgerLoops algorithm will soon be published through the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
This will allow you to implement your own LedgerLoops-compatible software.
In the future, we plan to make more resources available such as a test suite and a test net where you can analyse the performance
and compliance of your software, as well as a public global backbone network for obligaction clearing, and software-as-a-service solutions.
